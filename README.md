# Project Name

**Author**: Conor McCue
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application takes in spoofed data in the form of JSON files and references them to display the map and weather of a queried location.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Inside the terminal of your favorite IDE use npm to install the necessary dependencies from the package.JSON file. 
3. Create a heroku application containing the files contained within this repository. 


## Architecture
<!-- This application uses HTML,CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end design. The back-end utilizes node.js as a runtime environment with express packaged on top for Quality of Life. The back-end is written entirely in JavaScript.  -->

## Change Log
 Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

11-05-2019 8:05am - Application now has a full scaffold.

11-05-2019 9:20am - Application now displays a map of the proper locale for the search string.

11-05-2019 10:49am - Application now displays the weather of the locale referenced through the search string.

11-05-2019 12:05pm - Application now has integrated error handling for locales outside of the dataset.
